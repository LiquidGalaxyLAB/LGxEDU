Liquid Galaxy for Education is a project which consists of bringing Liquid Galaxy to children by using Chromebooks as screens and a tablet as a controller. By that this project aims to introduce children the benefits of Liquid Galaxy and a completely new learning method for subjects like Geography and History.

The Liquid Galaxy for Education project has two parts:

- LiquidGalaxy on ChromeBooks: A complete installation guide to make LiquidGalaxy work on Chromebooks.

- An Android Application designed for tablets from 7 to 10 inches that runs the educational app. This Android App also includes the GSoC 2016 project developed by Ivan Josa: [https://github.com/navijo/Liquid-Galaxy-POIs-Controller/](https://github.com/navijo/Liquid-Galaxy-POIs-Controller/)
